# Spark Cluster as a Service in Docker

This extends the [docker-spark](https://github.com/P7h/docker-spark) repo,
which creates a [Spark](http://spark.apache.org) cluster in a
[docker](http://www.docker.com) image by making it a service (avoid having to
run the start commands) and/or use it in a docker compose configuration.

Note that the version of the image is defined in
[makefile](https://github.com/plandes/docker-spark-service/blob/master/makefile#L1)
and coresponds to the `docker-spark` docker image and Spark version.


## Obtaining the Image

The image is available on
[docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/plandes/docker-spark-service/) or by
pulling it with:
```bash
$ docker pull plandes/docker-spark-service
```


## Docker Compose

The following is an example docker compose file:
```yaml
spark-service:
  container_name: spark
  image: plandes/docker-spark-service:2.0.2
  hostname: spark
  ports:
    - "8080:8080"
    - "8081:8081"
    - "4040:4040"
  volumes:
    - /Volumns/spark-mount:/root
  links:
    - nlpserv
```

To use this, create the mount point and start docker:
```bash
$ mkdir -p /Volumns/spark-mount
$ docker-compose up -d
```
